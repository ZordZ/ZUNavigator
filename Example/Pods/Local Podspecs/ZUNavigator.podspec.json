  "description": "Navigator allows you to reduce dependencies between controllers without calling them directly and make modular app, where each module is pod for example.\nList of main features:\n- Make push/pop segues by url.\n- Prevent push segue if view controller already in view controllers stack or if in next tab - depends on policy.\n- Update data on pop segue in target view controller.\n- Simple switch tabs or switch tabs with segue.\n- Call update method by url in first matching target view controller in stack. Or every matching. Or in next tabs. - depends on policy.\n- Call update by url everywhere in app.(Navigation and tab bar controllers must be registered in Navigator - or use ZNTabBarController/ZNBavigationController).\n- Prints links map of your stack.\n- And some other things.\nAll public methods documented and separated to files for fast access. Look at classes root folder.",
